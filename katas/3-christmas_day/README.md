# The Ghost of Christmas Past 🎅🎄👻

Christmas, this year, falls on a Wednesday! 

But on which day did Christmas fall in years past?

## Problem Description

Write a Ruby class that returns the correct weekday of Christmas Day for previous years.  

## Requirements and Constraints

### Requirements 

Your code should return the name of the day of the week that Christmas Day was:
- Officially celebrated
- In England
- Using the relative local date and time

### Constraints 

**You may not use Ruby's `Date` or `Time` classes, nor any other third party library to perform date computations for you**. Your solution should be derived from first-principles, implementing the logic yourself.

### Input Specifications

See the attached tests.

### Output Specifications

See the attached tests. All tests must pass!

## Examples and Test Cases

See the attached tests.

## Getting started 

1. Make sure your local repository is up to date with origin and you are on the `main` branch.
2. `bin/cleo_katas attempt christmas_day`
3. `ruby katas/3-christmas_day/[yourname]/test.rb`
